# 3 ft by 4 ft on average with most fast food tables could possibly have a hard line to an outlet or possibly a usb wire from the table top where the table top has a thin Qi recharging pad made as a hardtop instead of a flexible pad surface as part of the exterior of the existing table top


i emailed coolerscreens.com hoping they have contacts to upgrade major fast food tables to rechargeable
i figure maybe $50 per table on average to upgrade based on labor and part

as a fastened item without slipping from the table
or an item that wraps around the table securely 

$25 part $25 labor go figure........on your own average per restaurant?

i also mentioned to coolerscreens.com about completely see through Samsung display technology as an improvement to the store fridge with a digital display built-in
